## Installation

Follow the steps below to get the **ScrapeBackend API** up and running:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v14+)
- **MongoDB** (local or cloud, such as MongoDB Atlas)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YuvrajKarna/ScrapeBackend-API.git
cd ScrapeBackend-API
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set the following environment variables:

```bash
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=5000
```

Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your MongoDB connection URI.

### 4. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run devStart
```

This will start the server on the specified port (`5000` by default) with hot reloading enabled.

---

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with the API via HTTP requests. The API supports both real-time scraping and retrieving stored data.

### Example Request (GET)

To get a list of all scraped books from the database:

```bash
GET http://localhost:5000/api/scrape/books
```

### Additional Notes:

- **Scalability**: The project is designed to scale easily. You can extend it to support more complex scraping logic, additional APIs, or more databases.
- **Error Handling**: Ensure you add proper error handling in your own code when interacting with the API.
- **Puppeteer**: Scraping performance can depend on the complexity of the target website. Puppeteer is used here for headless browser-based scraping, but you may need to tweak it for certain sites.
